  <P style="margin-top:35px;">One other idea i had was to create a instant flight ticket app/website where guys tent to book something or somewhere instantly at the moment but the tickets are pretty expensive, what if i could provide a way that this country: cheapest way to go is this much and u can just go (its gotta be under $150) plus as long as its super cheap its okay.<br>
