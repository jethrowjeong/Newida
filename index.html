  Newida: 새로운 아이디어를 누가 같이 했으면 하는 왭

  <h3><a href="https://valepark.squarespace.com/" target="_blank" title="PW:12345 Valet park for you anywhere">Valepak </a></h3>
  <p>This is a website for those who wants their car to be parked but doesn't want to get any ticket or hates to drive around the block the park at a right spot. In this way drivers can leave the car at the place where they want to and have the car ready when they need it anywhere. It can be simply seen as <strong>a <u>valet parker</u> in the city</strong>. Furthermore, this website will allow people to park at a place for a long time at a very cheap price or no price so that a person doesn't have to worry about where to park and how long they are parking at a certain place.</p>
  <h3>LottoInvest</h3>
  <p style="margin-top:40px;">Next idea i had in mind was to create a website to circulate investments basically a crowdfunding for startups, however once i think about it, this is just a dumb way to use ur money.</p>
  <h3>ImprompTrip</h3>
  <P style="margin-top:35px;">One other idea i had was to create a instant flight ticket app/website where guys tent to book something or somewhere instantly at the moment but the tickets are pretty expensive, what if i could provide a way that this country: cheapest way to go is this much and u can just go (its gotta be under $150) plus as long as its super cheap its okay.
